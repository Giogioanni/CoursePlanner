**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

_In this course i was solving the complexity of usage of different data structures (Hash, Binary Search Tree, and Vector) and where they are appropriate in certain circumstances._

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

 _I weighed the pros and cons of each data strucure to the current circumstance at hand. It's crucial to understand the nature of each data structure and how it aligns with the requirements of the project._

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

_Reasearching and reading what others say about each data structure, getting insight by analyzing examples helped alot also._

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

_Big O analysis has expanded and influenced my perspective of algorithmic designsm, I've deepened my understanding of the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of the respective data structures._

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

_My work on this project has transformed my approach to software development, emphasizing the importance of choosing appropriate data structures, modular design, and clear documentation. Through this process, I've evolved my problem-solving skills, improved collaboration and communication, and developed a mindset focused on continuously improving the quality and longevity of the software I create._
